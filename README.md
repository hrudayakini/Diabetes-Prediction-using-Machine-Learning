**About the Dataset**

**Context**  
The dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The primary goal is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various diagnostic measurements. This dataset is essential for developing models that can aid in early diagnosis and intervention for diabetes, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

**Content**  
The dataset includes specific constraints and details regarding patient selection:

- **Patient Demographics**  
  All patients are females, at least 21 years old, and of Pima Indian heritage.

The dataset comprises the following features:

1. **Pregnancies**  
   - Description: Number of times the patient has been pregnant.  
   - Type: Numeric (Integer)  
   - Relevance: Previous pregnancies can impact the likelihood of diabetes due to physiological changes during pregnancy.

2. **Glucose**  
   - Description: Plasma glucose concentration measured two hours after an oral glucose tolerance test.  
   - Type: Numeric (Float)  
   - Relevance: High plasma glucose levels are a key indicator of diabetes.

3. **BloodPressure**  
   - Description: Diastolic blood pressure in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).  
   - Type: Numeric (Float)  
   - Relevance: Blood pressure levels can be indicative of overall cardiovascular health, which is often linked to diabetes.

4. **SkinThickness**  
   - Description: Triceps skin fold thickness in millimeters.  
   - Type: Numeric (Float)  
   - Relevance: This measurement can indicate subcutaneous fat levels, which may be associated with insulin resistance and diabetes.

5. **Insulin**  
   - Description: 2-hour serum insulin in micro-units per milliliter (mu U/ml).  
   - Type: Numeric (Float)  
   - Relevance: Insulin levels are crucial for understanding insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes.

6. **BMI (Body Mass Index)**  
   - Description: Weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/mÂ²).  
   - Type: Numeric (Float)  
   - Relevance: BMI is a significant indicator of obesity, which is a major risk factor for diabetes.

7. **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**  
   - Description: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.  
   - Type: Numeric (Float)  
   - Relevance: Family history is a strong predictor of diabetes risk.

8. **Age**  
   - Description: Age of the patient in years.  
   - Type: Numeric (Integer)  
   - Relevance: Age is a risk factor, as the likelihood of developing diabetes increases with age.

9. **Outcome**  
   - Description: Class variable indicating the presence of diabetes.  
   - Values: 0 (Non-diabetic), 1 (Diabetic)  
   - Type: Categorical (Binary)  
   - Relevance: This is the target variable that models aim to predict.
